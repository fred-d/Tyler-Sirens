## About

### inspiration

Back before [TWD](https://tylerwebdev.io/) was a thing, there was a small group that went by the name of [Hack Tyler](http://hacktyler.com/). While the history and ethics of the group are somewhat of a gray area, they are still attributed as being one of the first of its kind in the Tyler area. Before their presence was known, there were no clubs or organizations based around hacking/programming that encouraged community in Tyler. For that, Hack Tyler should be remembered as being ahead of its time.

This project was inspired by Hack Tyler's [Siren Project](http://sirens.hacktyler.com/), which is no longer in a working state after the Tyler Police Department revamped their internal dispatching systems. This Project aims to emulate that of what the Hack Tyler did.
