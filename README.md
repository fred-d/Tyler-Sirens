## About
### Inspiration

Back before [TWD](https://tylerwebdev.io/) was a thing, there was a group that went by the name of [Hack Tyler](http://hacktyler.com/). Before their presence was known, there were no clubs or organizations based around programming that encouraged community in Tyler. For that, Hack Tyler should be remembered as being ahead of its time. Part of Tyler Web Dev's mission is to continue the work done by those before us who have sought to build a tech community in Tyler - this project is part of that continuation. 

This project was inspired by Hack Tyler's [Siren Project](http://sirens.hacktyler.com/), which is no longer in a working state after the Tyler Police Department revamped their internal dispatching systems. This Project aims to emulate that of what the Hack Tyler did.
